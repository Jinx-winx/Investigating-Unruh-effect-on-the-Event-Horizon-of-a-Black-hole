# Investigating-Unruh-effect-on-the-Event-Horizon-of-a-Black-hole
A mini project forming the first step of my Master’s thesis. It explores black holes as thermodynamic systems leading to Hawking radiation, followed by an introduction to the Unruh effect, discussing temperature calculations and the shared quantum field framework underlying both phenomena. The report of this project is attached in this repository, which includes a detailed study and derivation on how Unruh effect and Hawking radiation are related. The abstract of the project is as follows:

 Based on the propositions of S. W. Hawking, black holes are known to emit radiation with a thermal spectrum. This phenomenon reveals that black holes can be treated as thermodynamic systems characterized by well-defined temperature and entropy. Interestingly, a similar effect arises for an accelerating observer in flat spacetime: a quantum field that appears as vacuum in a stationary Minkowski frame is perceived as a thermal bath in a uniformly accelerating frame, described by Rindler coordinates.This project aims to present the thermodynamic interpretation of black holes, discuss the laws governing their thermal emission, and derive the Unruh temperature from first principles in non-inertial (Rindler) frames. Although the underlying spacetime remains flat, the accelerating observer experiences an event horizon analogous to that of a black hole. By establishing this parallel, the work highlights the deep connection between Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect.
