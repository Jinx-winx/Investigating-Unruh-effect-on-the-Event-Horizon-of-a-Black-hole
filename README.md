# Investigating-Unruh-effect-on-the-Event-Horizon-of-a-Black-hole
A mini project forming the first step of my Master’s thesis. It explores black holes as thermodynamic systems leading to Hawking radiation, followed by an introduction to the Unruh effect, discussing temperature calculations and the shared quantum field framework underlying both phenomena.
